            <h3>Know More About BMI</h3>

            <p>
            Ever wondered if your weight is in a healthy range? That's exactly what Body Mass Index — or BMI — helps you figure out. It’s a quick calculation based on your height and weight that gives you an idea of whether you’re underweight, at a healthy weight, overweight, or obese. Think of it as a simple “first check” on your overall health.
            </p>
            <p>
            Knowing your BMI can be eye-opening. If it's in the healthy range, great — you're on the right track! If it’s higher or lower than ideal, it’s a gentle nudge to take a closer look at your eating habits, physical activity, and lifestyle choices.
            </p>
            
            <p>Here's what the main BMI categories mean:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Underweight (BMI < 18.5):</b> Your body might not be getting all the nutrients it needs. This can lead to feeling tired, weaker immunity, and slower recovery.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Healthy Weight (18.5-24.9):</b> This is considered the sweet spot. People in this range generally enjoy better energy, better health, and a lower risk of chronic diseases.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Overweight (25-29.9):</b> You're carrying a little more weight than your body needs. Small, steady changes in diet and exercise can help bring you back into the healthy zone.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Obese (30-39.9):</b> At this level, the risk of serious health problems like heart disease and type 2 diabetes increases. Structured lifestyle changes can make a real difference.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Extremely Obese (≥ 40):</b> This range carries the highest health risks and often benefits from professional guidance to plan safe weight management.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            <p>
            Remember, BMI is just one piece of the health puzzle. It doesn't directly measure body fat, fitness, or muscle mass — so athletes or very muscular people may get a misleading number. Use your BMI as a starting point, then combine it with other indicators like waist size, activity level, and overall well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
            Most importantly, don't panic about the number. See it as feedback. Small, consistent improvements in eating well, staying active, and looking after your mental health can help you move toward your goals — no crash diets or extreme workouts needed.
            </p>
