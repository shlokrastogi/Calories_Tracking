        <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple measurement that uses your height and weight to estimate whether you are underweight, at a healthy weight, overweight, or obese.
        <br><br> 
            Calculating your BMI can help you understand your body composition and identify potential health risks linked to being under- or overweight. While it doesn’t directly measure body fat, it’s a useful screening tool for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
        <br><br>
            On Fitness Tracker, you can easily calculate your BMI and use it as a guide to plan your calorie intake and protein requirements.

        <h3>Importance of Food</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Food is the body’s main source of energy. Each meal provides calories that fuel your daily activities, exercise, and even basic bodily functions like breathing and digestion. Choosing the right number of calories and nutrient-rich foods helps maintain a healthy weight and supports an active lifestyle.
        <br><br>    
            A balanced diet with the correct calorie intake improves concentration, strengthens immunity, and helps prevent lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart problems. Making mindful food choices today lays the foundation for long-term health and vitality.
