            <h3>Importance of BMI</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple measurement that uses your height and weight to estimate whether you are underweight, at a healthy weight, overweight, or obese.
            <br><br> 
                On Fitness Tracker, you can easily calculate your BMI and use it as a guide to plan your calorie intake and protein requirements.

            <h3>Importance of Healthy Food</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Food is the bodyâ€™s main source of energy. Each meal provides calories that fuel your daily activities, exercise, and even basic bodily functions like breathing and digestion.
                <br><br>
                Choosing the right number of calories and nutrient-rich foods helps maintain a healthy weight and supports an active lifestyle.
